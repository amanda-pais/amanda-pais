## Hello World!

## About me 
As a passionate software engineering student transitioning careers, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the world of coding. My recent completion of a software engineering bootcamp has equipped me with proficiency in Python and a keen interest in tackling challenging projects.

I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my coding skills and I am eager to connect with fellow developers, contribute to open-source projects, and explore new opportunities for learning and growth. 
### Let's code together and make a difference! :)
